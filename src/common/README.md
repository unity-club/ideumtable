## Coffee Table Common Dependencies

This folder contains any code that might be shared as a common dependency between applications, services, and libraries that run on the Coffee Table. For instance, the `CoffeeTable.Messaging` solution contains classes that may be used to send messages between the Ideum service and the user applications. Because this code must be shared by multiple projects, it is stored here for reference.
